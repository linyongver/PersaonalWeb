# About Me
I am currently a third-year Ph.D student in [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk), supervised by [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org) starting from Sep 2018. Before my Ph.D journey, I obtained my Bachelor degree in [Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

I am interested in broader topics in machine learning and computer vision. Currently, I am working on adversarial examples.
