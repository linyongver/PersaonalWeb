# About Me

I am an CSE PhD sudent in [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk) HKUST, supervised by Professor [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). Out of Distribution  (OOD) Generalization , Robustess of Deep Learning and Learning theory are my research interests. 

If you are also interested in discussing / cooperating with me on OOD, you can contact me by Email (ylindf(A)connect.ust.hk {A = @}). 

I have lunched a blog on Invariant Risk Minimization [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/567666715) (in Chinese).
